				<p>
					You assume certain risks in using a service such as SAGASHI.{" "}
					<strong>
						SAGASHI is not involved with, nor provides a warranty for, any transaction between
						Buyers and Sellers, does not have or take title to any Products, and does not warrant
						that a Buyer or Seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.
					</strong>{" "}
					You as a Buyer and/or Seller assume, agree, and understand you bear all of the risks in
					selling or purchasing Products on the Services.
				</p>
				<p>
					For your safety, we discourage off-site transactions and the sharing of contact
					information, including email addresses and phone numbers, prior to completing a
					transaction through the Services. Initiating conversations regarding a Product purchase
					outside of the Services, completing purchases outside of the Services, and soliciting
					users to SAGASHI competitors or attempting to circumvent SAGASHI fees by completing
					transactions initiated on SAGASHI off-site, are considered off-site activities. If you
					choose to engage in off-site activities, SAGASHI makes no representations or warranties of
					any kind, express or implied, about the reliability, accuracy, suitability, safety, or
					authenticity of communications or transactions performed off-site or the individuals
					involved in such transactions. All off-site activity is strictly at your own risk.
					Moreover, transactions conducted outside of the Services are not eligible for any
					protection provided by SAGASHI. SAGASHI reserves the right to suspend or terminate your
					access to the Services for any reason in accordance with these Terms, including in the
					event of any off-site activity, as determined solely by SAGASHI.
				</p>
				<li className="text-lg font-bold">Seller Terms</li>
				<p>
					When you sell Products through the Services, you are considered a Seller and you agree to
					the terms in the following provisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					To sell a Product through the Services, Sellers must publish pictures and information
					about the Products (&quot;Product Listing&quot;).
				</p>
				<p>
					As a Seller, you agree that: <strong>(a)</strong> you are solely responsible for the
					accuracy and content of any Product Listing, including its lawfulness;{" "}
					<strong>(b)</strong> you have all rights necessary to sell your Products;{" "}
					<strong>(c)</strong> you will not list or sell any counterfeit Products;{" "}
					<strong>(d)</strong> we cannot guarantee exact Product Listing durations;{" "}
					<strong>(e)</strong> we may modify Product Listings at our sole discretion;{" "}
					<strong>(f)</strong> you authorize us to offer your Product Listing for sale in any such
					manner as we deem appropriate, including by making your Product Listing available on other
					platforms, websites and/or mobile applications, including those operated by us or our
					affiliates; <strong>(g)</strong> we reserve the right to delete any Product Listings for
					any reason upon notice to you; <strong>(h)</strong> a Product Listing is not guaranteed to
					appear or not appear in any particular search and browse results; and <strong>(i)</strong>{" "}
					you are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the sale of
					your Products and you will promptly assist SAGASHI in its compliance with applicable laws
					and regulations, as requested by SAGASHI.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Services may include functionality for suggesting more effective selling, such as
					discounting Products and Product price suggestions, but Sellers have sole discretion to
					set prices.
				</p>
				<p>
					Buyers can buy Products from you immediately at the listed price. You cannot accept
					further offers on Products sold through the &quot;Purchase&quot; option. Alternatively,
					Buyers can negotiate the price of a Product with you. We will notify you if a potential
					Buyer makes an offer on your Product Listings. If you receive an offer, you can accept,
					counter, or decline that offer. If you accept an offer, you enter into a legally binding
					contract with the applicable Buyer, pursuant to which the Buyer is obligated to purchase
					the Product and you agree to ship the Product (as it is described in the Product Listing)
					to such Buyer for the price that you accepted. If you accept a non-binding offer, the
					Buyer must initiate fund transmission to you. Once funds transmission is initiated, you
					enter into a legally binding contract with the applicable Buyer to ship the Product (as it
					is described in the Product Listing) to such Buyer for the price that you accepted. If you
					counter or decline an offer, we will notify the Buyer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sellers must pay SAGASHI a commission on the total transaction amount received by a Seller
					(including VAT, if any, and any applicable shipping costs) in respect of any sale of a
					Product through the Services. SAGASHI also charges a payment processing fee for each
					transaction processed by its third-party Payment Processors. The fee amount will be
					assessed on the total transaction amount, including shipping and tax (if applicable).
					SAGASHI reserves the right to modify the payment processing fee at any time. The
					commission will be deducted from the amount paid by a Buyer to the Seller through the
					Payment Processor applicable to that transaction. Commission rates are subject to change
					at our sole discretion, upon notice to you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Except as otherwise set forth herein, Seller&rsquo;s account will be credited with the
					amount equal to the purchase price, minus taxes, SAGASHI&rsquo;s commission, SAGASHI
					Labels costs (if applicable), and any applicable fees no later than three (3) calendar
					days after the tracking information indicates that the Product has been delivered to the
					Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, SAGASHI may hold on crediting a
					Seller account for a period necessary for SAGASHI to determine that a Product has actually
					been delivered to resolve a Buyer-initiated claim, or if prescribed by applicable laws or
					regulations. Seller may redeem credited amounts through SAGASHI&rsquo;s permitted
					third-party Payment Processors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event SAGASHI determines that a
					shipment was not fulfilled (including if the tracking information provided appears to have
					been fraudulent; SAGASHI determines that the Product shipped is not as described on the
					Product Listing; the Product is unlawful, etc.) or SAGASHI is subject to a chargeback
					imposed by a Payment Processor as a result of Seller&rsquo;s failure to fulfill a
					shipment, as determined by SAGASHI or a Payment Processor, Seller is required to provide a
					full refund, including shipping fees, to the applicable Buyer or SAGASHI (as applicable).
					If Seller fails to timely refund the Buyer, SAGASHI may refund the Buyer on the
					Seller&rsquo;s behalf. If Seller is located in a jurisdiction that allows automatic
					debits, such Seller&rsquo;s account will be automatically debited by SAGASHI for the
					amount refunded by SAGASHI, or the chargeback amount (as applicable). SAGASHI may also
					charge Seller any associated dispute fees charged by the Payment Processor, at
					SAGASHI&rsquo;s sole discretion. Seller hereby agrees to such automatic debiting. If
					Seller is not eligible for automatic debits, Seller is required to promptly repay SAGASHI
					for the refund, the chargeback amount, and any applicable dispute fees and a debt will be
					created for the amount that Seller owes SAGASHI for the refund. Whilst the debt remains
					outstanding, SAGASHI may suspend or terminate Seller&rsquo;s access to the Services in
					accordance with these Terms. If a Seller fails to promptly repay any outstanding debt to
					SAGASHI, SAGASHI may pursue any legal action available to it against such Seller,
					including retaining collection agencies at your cost.
				</p>
				<p>
					SAGASHI may grant certain Sellers the ability to choose to offer promotions specifically
					for their own shops and/or Product Listings through Seller-generated discounts on the
					listing price(s) by a percentage or an amount. Sellers may be able to discount a single
					Product Listing or multiple Product Listings at once. Discounted prices are public and
					will be displayed to all Buyers. SAGASHI may also grant certain Sellers the ability to
					offer a discounted price on Product Listings that is only sent to the users that have
					favorited a specific Product Listing. On occasion, SAGASHI may (in its sole discretion)
					aggregate Seller discounts and promote them through our Services, including via our
					websites, apps, and emails. When a Seller runs a promotion or discount, Seller is
					obligated to comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including consumer
					protection rules). Sellers may not use promotions to avoid fees.
				</p>

				<p>
					You (as a Seller) and SAGASHI are independent controllers of Buyer data. We each
					independently determine the purposes and means of processing Buyer data and therefore
					SAGASHI is not responsible for any Seller&rsquo;s use of Buyer data. Sellers must comply
					with applicable data protection laws with respect to a Seller&rsquo;s collection, use, and
					processing of Buyer data. If we are found to jointly control such Buyer data and we are
					held responsible in any way for its use by you, you agree to indemnify us.
