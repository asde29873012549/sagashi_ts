							geometry that can be used to compare your selfie to the image on the identity document
							you provided to determine the likelihood that the images are a &quot;match.&quot; We
							do not receive the biometric identifier generated from the images. It is generated and
							held by Persona until we inform them that the biometric identifier is no longer needed
							for the purposes described in this paragraph and must be destroyed. For identity
							verification and security purposes, we will have access to the selfie image and will
							receive the information extracted from the scan of the government ID document as well
							as the results of the identity verification process. We may use this process and
							associated information to verify your identity, authenticate your identity documents,
							comply with legal obligations and protect against fraud and misrepresentation. We do
							not use, disclose or retain your biometric information for any other commercial
							purpose. Our third-party provider, Persona, processes this information on our behalf
							strictly in accordance with our contractual agreements. For more information on
							Persona&apos;s data processing practices, please see Persona&apos;s Privacy Policy
